# lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries
i was going to do a python file for each one of them, but I realized that they are all very similar. 
so, i'm going to list the differences between them here.

## lists:
* lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
* lists are mutable, meaning that their values can be changed.
* it allows duplicate values.

## tuples:
* tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
* tuples are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed.
* it does not allow duplicate values.

## sets:
* sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
* sets are unordered, meaning that their order cannot be changed.

## dictionaries:
* dictionaries are used to store key:value pairs in a single variable.
* dictionaries are mutable, meaning that their values can be changed.
