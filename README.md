# Learning Python
Python is not hard, but learning how to code it is. I quit a thousand times, I feel my brain **slowing dying** because of AI.

I hate the feeling of not being able to understand code in a daily basis and run to AI to solve everything for me, **I'll quit it.**

I won't let my knowledge gap on programming control me anymore.

# This is my frest start.

# Objective
* Master Python by November of 2026.
* I want to become an AI/ML Engineer focused on AIOps, Observability and Infrastructure Automation, combining my passion for DevOps.

# Projects I need to do in order to show that **I'm actually learning**
- [ ] A script to organize my obsidian files. 

# Resources
* I'm using **NotebookLM** as my study buddy fulled with Python sources.
* I'm following the AI Engineer Path on Campus, learning Python from the start.
* I'll be reading Python books, participating in forums, sites.

> I won't give up, I'll keep on learning and coming back up as much as I need to.
