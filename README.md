## 📚 About This Repository

This is my personal learning journey through Python fundamentals. After relying too heavily on AI-powered coding assistants (vibe-coding), I decided to take a step back and build a solid foundation in Python from scratch.

**Goal:** Master Python fundamentals to become a better AI Engineer who understands the code, not just generates it.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- **Course:** AI Engineer Learning Pathway (Thoughtworks Campus)
- **Module:** Python Language Fundamentals: Syntax to Structures
- **Platform:** Udemy + W3Schools practice
- **Duration:** ~8 hours of content

## 🚀 Learning Objectives

### Phase 1: Python Fundamentals *(Current)*
- [x] Variables and constants
- [x] Comments and documentation
- [x] Basic data types
- [x] Dictionaries and nested structures
- [x] Loops and conditionals
- [ ] Functions and modules
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Object-oriented basics
- [ ] Decorators and generators

### Phase 2: Data Structures
- [ ] Lists, tuples, sets
- [ ] List comprehensions
- [ ] Advanced dictionary operations
- [ ] Collections module

### Phase 3: Applied Python for AI/ML
- [ ] NumPy fundamentals
- [ ] Pandas for data manipulation
- [ ] Data visualization basics
- [ ] First ML model

### Phase 4: AIOps Projects
- [ ] Anomaly detection systems
- [ ] AI Evals implementation
- [ ] AI Agents for investigation

## 💡 Key Learnings So Far

### Dictionaries and Loops
```python
# Formatting nested dictionaries - my breakthrough moment!
for key, value in data.items():
    if type(value) == dict:
        print(f"{key}:")
        for sub_key, sub_value in value.items():
            print(f"  {sub_key}: {sub_value}")
    else:
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

### Important Concepts Discovered
- Variables in loops are GENERIC (they receive each pair)
- Python cares about POSITION, not variable names
- Indentation is CRITICAL (especially with if/else)
- `type()` checking for handling different data structures
- Scope matters - can only use variables that exist!

## 🛠️ Development Setup

- **IDE:** PyCharm (pure, without AI assistance initially)
- **Python Version:** 3.x
- **Learning Approach:** 
  - Weeks 1-4: Pure coding without AI
  - Weeks 5-8: Coding with occasional AI consultation
  - After: Strategic AI usage for acceleration

## 📝 Learning Philosophy

1. **Type everything manually** - build muscle memory
2. **Embrace errors** - they're learning opportunities
3. **Understand, don't memorize** - know the "why"
4. **Document everything** - future me will thank current me
5. **No vibe-coding** - if I can't explain it, I don't use it

## 🎓 Background

**Who:** Larissa D. Marques  
**Role:** Infrastructure Engineer & AI Engineer @ Thoughtworks (DAMO Team)  
**Why This Matters:** Leading AI/ML projects requires deep understanding, not just surface-level code generation

## 📊 Progress Tracking

## 💭 Notes to Self

> "Estou construindo uma base sólida. Cada erro é um aprendizado, cada conceito dominado é um passo em direção à maestria. Não é sobre velocidade, é sobre profundidade."
