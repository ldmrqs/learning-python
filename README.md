# This is my frest start
Python is not hard, but learning how to code it is. I quit a thousand times, I feel my brain **slowing dying** because of AI.

I hate the feeling of not being able to understand code in a daily basis and run to AI to solve everything for me, **I'll quit it.**

I won't let my knowledge gap on programming control me anymore.
