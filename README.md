## 📚 About This Repository

This is my personal learning journey through Python fundamentals. After relying too heavily on AI-powered coding assistants (vibe-coding), I decided to take a step back and build a solid foundation in Python from scratch.

**Goal:** Master Python fundamentals to become a better AI Engineer who understands the code, not just generates it.
